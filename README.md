Code for producing data movies in SAS and R.

This program contains instructions and code to produce several types of data movies in SAS and R. Data movies can be used to investigate trends in the epidemiology of disease (e.g. case counts, risks, rates) across multiple population characteristics at once (e.g. age, sex, race, geographic region).

The code produces example data movies using publicly available data on HIV diagnoses in the US. The examples are simplified versions of the data movies published here: https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2020.306131.
